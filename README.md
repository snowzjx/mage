MAGE: Memory-Aware Garbling Engine
==================================

MAGE is a memory-aware garbling engine. It is written in C++. To build, use g++ version 9 or later or clang++ version 6 or later.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
This is still in progress, but it's far enough along that you can run the code.

To build MAGE, first install OpenSSL. Also install version 0.63 of the yaml-cpp library (https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp).

Once you've done this, you should be able to run `make`. I've tested this on an Ubuntu 16.04 system.
